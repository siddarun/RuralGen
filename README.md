## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Import Errors (CLIPTextModel, etc.)
**Problem**: `cannot import name 'CLIPTextModel' from 'transformers'`
**Solution**: The notebook automatically fixes dependency conflicts. Run the first cell.

#### 2. Black/Empty Images
**Problem**: Generated images are completely black
**Solution**: 
- Restart kernel after dependency installation
- Use float32 instead of float16 if issues persist
- Check GPU memory availability

#### 3. CUDA Out of Memory
**Problem**: `RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory`
**Solution**:
- Reduce batch size to 1
- Enable CPU offloading: `pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()`
- Use smaller image resolution (512x512)

#### 4. Slow Generation
**Problem**: Very slow image generation
**Solution**:
- Use the enhanced speed optimization techniques
- Reduce inference steps to 15-20
- Enable xformers: `pip install xformers`

### Environment-Specific Fixes

#### Google Colab
```python
# Add this cell for Colab optimization
!pip install --upgrade diffusers transformers accelerate
# Restart runtime after installation
```

#### Kaggle
```python
# Kaggle-specific optimizations
import os
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'
torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(0.9)
```
